# iPhone Wikipedia Reader!
### A mobile wikipedia reader that aims to solve the annoyances of reading wikipedia on mobile. 
##### *Created as part of my final project for CS 4530 Mobile App Development (iOS) at the University of Utah*

### Rationale 
When I browse Wikipedia on PC, I tend to open dozens of tabs as I run into tangential topics of interest. I go back and and fourth between open tabs and build a queue of articles I am interested in reading. Since tabs on mobile browsers are slow and clunky, this kind of browsing experience just isn’t typically possible on mobile. 

I have built a mobile Wikipedia browser where instead of immediatly following links to other articles, linked articles are automatically added to a queue of articles you are interested in viewing. This queue of articles is automatically downloaded in the background can be navigated, pushed to, and popped from as desired. The HTML and scroll position of each article will be saved for all articles in theset, making viewing speedy and consistent when navigating between articles.
