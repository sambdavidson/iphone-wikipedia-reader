# iPhone Wikipedia Reader!
### A mobile wikipedia reader that aims to solve the annoyances of browsing wikipedia on mobile. 
##### *Created as part of my final project for CS 4530 Mobile App Development (iOS) at the University of Utah*

### Rationale 
When I browse Wikipedia on PC, I tend to open dozens of tabs as I run into tangential topics of interest. I go back and fourth between open tabs and build a queue of articles I am interested in reading. Since tabs on mobile browsers are slow and clunky, this kind of browsing experience just isnâ€™t typically possible on mobile. 

I have built a mobile Wikipedia browser where instead of immediatly following links to other articles, linked articles are automatically added to a queue of articles you are interested in viewing. This queue of articles is automatically downloaded in the background, can be quickly navigated, pushed to, and pruned as desired. The HTML and scroll position is maintained for all articles in the queue, making viewing speedy and consistent when navigating between articles.
